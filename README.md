DCF77
=====

A library for the Arduino Project to deal with the DCF77 time broadcast service.

As there where many libraries dealing with the handling of the DCF77 broadcast service, they all lag of some nice features. 

I found the work of ... which handles the DCF signal even in noisy environments.
Also found the work of ... which has a very good interface to the Time library to work together with other time services als well as an hardware RTC.

These features together I need for my current project, so I will try to put the best of both together.
